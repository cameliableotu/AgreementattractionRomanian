<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:

research, Adina Camelia Bleotu, of the University of Bucharest, and Brian Dillon, of the University of Massachusetts
Amherst, are investigating the processes involved in the comprehension of
English sentences. The information collected in this study will be used in the preparation
of papers for presentation in international conferences and journals on
language. You are eligible to participate in this study because you are a
native speaker of Romanian, over 18 years of age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'><u>Procedures<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'>In this study, you will first be asked a few questions about your
language background, and then you will be asked to fill in a sentence by choosing the best answer out of two answers as fast as you can.
Given that you are given only a few seconds to make your choice, you will have to be very fast in giving your answer. The entire
process should take about 15 minutes, if you work efficiently. Upon
completion, you will be rewarded with course credit, provided that your responses
indicate that you did read the dialogs and questions carefully. </p>
